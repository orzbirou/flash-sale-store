# Flash-Sale Store — Development Log

This file records each major development step: the prompt that initiated it, what was built, and key architectural decisions. Update this file at the end of every major task.

## Step 0: Architectural Guidelines & Agent Alignment

### Prompt

> I am building a Flash-Sale store using Node.js (Express & TypeScript) for the backend and Angular for the frontend. We have a strict 48-hour deadline, so we will use Express and Prisma with SQLite for speed and ease of execution, while maintaining a strict enterprise architecture.
>
> Before we start building the actual code, I want to establish a strict set of global rules and Best Practices that you must adhere to throughout the entire development process.
>
> Please perform the following actions in AGENT MODE:
> 1. Create a `.cursorrules` file in the root directory. Inside, define strict architecture guidelines based on our tech stack:
>    - Global: Strict TypeScript ("strict": true, no "any"), production-grade standard.
>    - Frontend (Angular): Functional `inject()` pattern only, no constructor DI, lightweight state management with Angular Signals, RxJS handled via `toSignal()`, Tailwind CSS for layout.
>    - Backend (Express): Layered architecture (Routes -> Controllers -> Services), global error handling middleware, input validation.
>    - Database (Prisma + SQLite): Race-condition protection via atomic updates (WHERE stock > 0), database transactions for multi-step writes, explicit indexing.
>    - Documentation: Requirement for updating `PROMPTS.md` at the end of each major task.
>
> 2. Create an initial `PROMPTS.md` file in the root directory.
> 3. Document this exact step inside `PROMPTS.md` under "# Step 0: Architectural Guidelines & Agent Alignment". Include the prompt we just used and state that these rules were defined upfront to ensure a clean, high-quality, modern architecture.
>
> Please create these two files only for now. Do not generate the backend or frontend directories yet—we will handle that in the next step. Let me know once complete.

### What Was Done

- Created **`.cursorrules`** in the project root with mandatory, stack-specific guidelines covering:
  - **Global**: Strict TypeScript (`"strict": true`), no `any`, production-grade standards.
  - **Frontend (Angular)**: Functional `inject()` only (no constructor DI), Angular Signals for state, RxJS via `toSignal()`, Tailwind CSS for layout.
  - **Backend (Express)**: Strict layered architecture (Routes → Controllers → Services → Prisma), global error-handling middleware, schema-based input validation.
  - **Database (Prisma + SQLite)**: Atomic stock decrements (`WHERE stock > 0`), `prisma.$transaction()` for multi-step writes, explicit indexing in the schema.
  - **Documentation**: Requirement to append a new step to this file after every major task.
- Created **`PROMPTS.md`** (this file) as the living development log for the project.
- Added **repository safety configuration**:
  - **`.gitignore`** — excludes `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.env`, SQLite files (`*.db`, `*.db-journal`), and Cursor-specific folders (`.cursor/`), plus common Node/Angular/Prisma artifacts.
  - **`README.md`** — project overview, tech stack, architecture highlights, and pointer to `.cursorrules` for development standards.

### Rationale

These rules were defined **upfront**—before any application code—to ensure a clean, high-quality, modern architecture across the full 48-hour build. By locking in conventions now (strict typing, layered backend, signal-based frontend, race-safe database patterns), every subsequent step inherits the same standards and avoids costly rework during the flash-sale implementation.

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| TypeScript | `strict: true`, no `any` | Catch bugs at compile time; enterprise-grade safety |
| Angular DI | `inject()` only | Modern functional pattern; aligns with current Angular direction |
| State | Signals + `toSignal()` | Lightweight, no heavy state library overhead |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Rapid, consistent UI under deadline |
| Backend shape | Routes → Controllers → Services | Clear separation of concerns; testable layers |
| Stock safety | Atomic `updateMany` with `stock > 0` | Prevents overselling under concurrent load |
| DB engine | SQLite via Prisma | Fast local dev; sufficient for MVP flash-sale scope |

### Files Created

- `.cursorrules`
- `PROMPTS.md`
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`

## Step 1: Requirements Ingestion & Monorepo Scaffolding

### Part 1 — Requirements Ingestion

#### Prompt

> Please perform Part 1 of Step 1 in AGENT MODE:
>
> 1. Create a `REQUIREMENTS.md` file in the root directory and ingest the exact raw task instructions inside.
> 2. Create a new section in `PROMPTS.md` titled "## Step 1: Requirements Ingestion & Monorepo Scaffolding" and document that the raw requirements were safely ingested into `REQUIREMENTS.md` to serve as our absolute truth for development.
>
> Please create and update these files only. Do not touch or create backend or frontend folders yet.

#### What Was Done

- Created **`REQUIREMENTS.md`** in the project root with the exact raw task instructions: flash-sale store scope, six functional requirements (pseudo-login, no oversell, stock decrement on add-to-cart, live remaining count, multi-item purchase, full frontend flow).
- The raw requirements were safely ingested into `REQUIREMENTS.md` to serve as our **absolute truth** for development—all subsequent design and implementation decisions must align with this document.

#### Rationale

Capturing requirements verbatim before scaffolding prevents scope drift during the 48-hour build. Critical constraints (atomic stock on cart add, live counts, no negative inventory) are now locked in a single reference file alongside architectural rules in `.cursorrules`.

#### Files Created / Updated

- `REQUIREMENTS.md` (created)
- `PROMPTS.md` (updated)

### Part 2 — Monorepo Scaffolding

#### Prompt

> Please perform Part 2 of Step 1:
>
> 1. Initialize the Frontend application via `npx @angular/cli new frontend` with `--standalone=true --style=css --routing=true`.
> 2. Initialize the Backend application: `/backend` directory, `npm init -y`, production deps (`express cors socket.io zod @prisma/client`), dev deps (`typescript @types/express @types/node @types/cors ts-node-dev prisma`), and `tsconfig.json` with `"strict": true`.
> 3. Configure root orchestration: root `npm init -y`, `concurrently` devDependency, and `start:backend` / `start:frontend` / `dev` scripts.
> 4. Update `PROMPTS.md` under Step 1 with Part 2 documentation.

#### What Was Done

- **Frontend**: Scaffolded `frontend/` with Angular CLI (`--standalone=true --style=css --routing=true --skip-git --defaults`). Used `@angular/cli@21` because `@latest` (v22) requires Node `>=22.22.3` and the environment runs Node `v22.22.0`. Generated standalone app with routing, CSS styling, and strict TypeScript (`strict: true` in `tsconfig.json`).
- **Backend**: Created `backend/`, ran `npm init -y`, installed production dependencies (`express`, `cors`, `socket.io`, `zod`, `@prisma/client`) and dev dependencies (`typescript`, `@types/express`, `@types/node`, `@types/cors`, `ts-node-dev`, `prisma`). Added `tsconfig.json` with `"strict": true`, Node-appropriate module resolution, and strict compiler flags (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitReturns`, etc.). Added `dev` and `build` scripts plus a placeholder `src/index.ts` entry point for root orchestration.
- **Root orchestration**: Initialized root `package.json`, installed `concurrently`, and added scripts:
  - `"start:backend": "npm run dev --prefix backend"`
  - `"start:frontend": "npm start --prefix frontend"`
  - `"dev": "concurrently \"npm run start:backend\" \"npm run start:frontend\""`

```

#### Rationale

Monorepo scaffolding with root `concurrently` scripts enables single-command local development (`npm run dev`) while keeping frontend and backend as independent npm packages. Strict TypeScript on both sides enforces `.cursorrules` from day one.

#### Files Created / Updated

- `frontend/` (scaffolded via Angular CLI)
- `backend/` (initialized with dependencies and `tsconfig.json`)
- `backend/src/index.ts` (placeholder)
- `package.json` (root, with orchestration scripts)
- `PROMPTS.md` (updated)

## Step 2: Database Design and Schema Configuration

### Prompt

> Implement Step 2: Prisma + SQLite schema (User, Product, CartItem, Order, OrderItem), indexes for flash-sale concurrency, seed script with 5 products, run migration and seed, document in PROMPTS.md.

### What Was Done

- Created **`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`** with five models (`User`, `Product`, `CartItem`, `Order`, `OrderItem`), `OrderStatus` enum, and explicit indexes for flash-sale hot paths (cart by `userId`, product browse by `name`, unique `userId+productId` on cart lines).
- Created **`backend/prisma.config.ts`** (Prisma 7 config with datasource URL and seed command).
- Created **`backend/.env.example`**; kept **`backend/.env`** (`DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"`).
- Created **`backend/prisma/seed.ts`** — idempotent seed of 5 limited-stock products.
- Created **`backend/prisma/tsconfig.json`** for seed TypeScript compilation.
- Added **`backend/src/lib/prisma.ts`** — shared Prisma client with `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3` (required in Prisma 7).
- Updated **`backend/package.json`** with `db:migrate`, `db:seed`, `db:reset` scripts.
- Installed: `ts-node`, `dotenv`, `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`, `better-sqlite3`, `@types/better-sqlite3`.
- Ran `prisma migrate dev --name init` and `prisma db seed` successfully.

### Design: Reservation-on-Cart Inventory

Stock decrements when items are **added to cart** (REQUIREMENTS.md #3), not at checkout:

- `Product.stock` = live remaining count (Socket.io broadcast in Step 3).
- Add to cart: atomic `updateMany` with `stock >= quantity`, then upsert `CartItem`.
- Checkout: snapshot `Order` + `OrderItem`, clear cart — no second stock decrement.
- Remove from cart: delete `CartItem`, increment `Product.stock`.

### Seed Products

| Product | Stock | Price |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Limited Edition Sneakers | 10 | $129.99 |
| Vintage Graphic Tee | 25 | $34.99 |
| Smart Watch Band | 50 | $19.99 |
| Wireless Earbuds | 5 | $79.99 |
| Insulated Water Bottle | 15 | $24.99 |

### Index Rationale

| Index | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `Product @@index([name])` | Browse listing |
| `CartItem @@unique([userId, productId])` | Safe upsert on add-to-cart |
| `CartItem @@index([userId])` | Hot path: load user's cart |
| `CartItem @@index([productId])` | Reverse lookup per product |
| `User @@index([name])` | Pseudo-login find-or-create |
| `Order @@index([userId])`, `@@index([status])`, `@@index([createdAt])` | Order history and filtering |
| `OrderItem @@index([orderId])`, `@@index([productId])` | Order line items |

No standalone `stock` index — atomic updates always filter by `id` first.

### Prisma 7 Note

Prisma 7 requires a driver adapter for SQLite. All `PrismaClient` usage must pass `{ adapter: new PrismaBetterSqlite3({ url }) }` — bare `new PrismaClient()` throws at runtime.

## Step 3: Backend Logic, Concurrency Services, and WebSockets

### Prompt

> Implement Step 3: layered Express API with atomic CartService, 5-minute CartCleanerService, transactional CheckoutService, Socket.io stock broadcasts, Zod validation, and global error handling.

### What Was Done

- **Schema migration:** Added `CartItem.expiresAt` + `@@index([expiresAt])` for 5-minute cart TTL and cleaner scans.
- **Infrastructure:** `AppError`, global `errorHandler`, Zod `validateBody`/`validateParams`, `asyncHandler`, `requireUser` (`x-user-id` header).
- **App bootstrap:** `app.ts` (Express + CORS + `/api` routes), `index.ts` (HTTP server + Socket.io + CartCleaner startup).
- **Services:**
  - `CartService` — atomic `addToCart` via `updateMany` + `count === 1` guard; `removeFromCart` restores stock in transaction.
  - `CheckoutService` — `$transaction` converts cart to `Order`/`OrderItem`, clears cart (no second stock decrement).
  - `CartCleanerService` — 60s interval; conditional delete on expired items + stock restore; race-safe vs checkout/re-add.
  - `StockBroadcastService` — emits `stock_updated` after add, remove, and expiry.
  - `AuthService`, `ProductService` — pseudo-login and catalog listing.
- **API routes:** `POST /api/auth/login`, `GET /api/products`, `GET/POST/DELETE /api/cart`, `POST /api/orders/checkout`.
- **Smoke test passed:** login → add to cart (stock 15→14) → checkout (order total 2499 cents).

### Atomic Add-to-Cart Pattern

```typescript
const decrementResult = await tx.product.updateMany({
  where: { id: productId, stock: { gte: quantity } },
  data: { stock: { decrement: quantity } },
});
if (decrementResult.count !== 1) throw new AppError(409, '...');
```

### WebSocket Events

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `stock_updated` | Add to cart, remove from cart, cart expiry |
| (none) | Checkout — stock already reserved |

Payload: `{ productId, stock }`
